# AURA — Clean Girl Tracker (Static Site)

## What’s inside
- Mobile-first **bottom nav**
- Pages: Home, Glow Shelf, Period, Sport, Journal, Mood, Routine
- **LocalStorage** saves (private on device)
- No build tools — just upload and it works on GitHub Pages

## How to deploy (root URL)
1) Create a new repo called **tandevxx.github.io**
2) Upload all files from this folder to the repo root
3) Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from branch (`main` / `(root)`)
4) Open **https://tandevxx.github.io** 🎀

## Dev notes
- Filenames are **all lowercase** to avoid 404s on GitHub Pages.
- You can customize colors in `style.css` under `:root` variables.
- Icons are simple SVGs in `assets/icons/`.
